= Thinking Sphinx

== Usage

First, if you haven't done so already, check out the main usage[http://ts.freelancing-gods.com/usage.html] page. Once you've done that, the next place to look for information is the specific method docs - ThinkingSphinx::Search and ThinkingSphinx::Index::Builder in particular.

Keep in mind that while Thinking Sphinx works for ActiveRecord with Merb, it doesn't yet support DataMapper (although that is planned).

== Contributing

Fork on GitHub and after you've committed tested patches, send a pull request.

To get the spec suite running, you will need to install the not-a-mock gem if you don't already have it:

  git clone git://github.com/freelancing-god/not-a-mock.git
  cd not-a-mock
  rake gem
  gem install pkg/not_a_mock-1.1.0.gem
  
Then install the ginger gem. The steps are the same, except that you might need to sudo the gem install:

  git clone git://github.com/freelancing-god/ginger.git
  cd ginger
  rake gem
  sudo gem install pkg/ginger-1.1.0.gem

Then set up your database:

  cp spec/fixtures/database.yml.default spec/fixtures/database.yml
  mysqladmin -u root create thinking_sphinx
  
Make sure you don't have another Sphinx daemon (searchd) running. If you do, quit it with "rake ts:stop"
in the app root.

You should now have a passing test suite from which to build your patch on.

  rake spec
  
If you get the message "Failed to start searchd daemon", run the spec with sudo:

  sudo rake spec
  
If you quit the spec suite before it's completed, you may be left with data in the test
database, causing the next run to have failures. Let that run complete and then try again.
